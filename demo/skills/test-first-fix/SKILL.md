# Test First Fix

Use this skill for bug-fix tasks where behavior is unclear.

## Workflow

1. Write or identify a failing test that reproduces the defect.
2. Confirm failure is deterministic.
3. Implement the minimum fix.
4. Re-run the failing test and adjacent tests.
5. Summarize root cause, fix, and residual risk.
