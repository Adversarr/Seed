# Repo Survey

Use this skill when the task starts with incomplete context.

## Workflow

1. Inspect repository shape and key entry points before editing.
2. Capture likely hotspots and constraints with explicit file references.
3. Prefer read-only tools first, then propose a narrow plan.
4. Confirm assumptions before making risky changes.

## Notes

- Keep summaries concise and evidence-backed.
- Use the `references/checklist.md` file as the minimum survey checklist.
